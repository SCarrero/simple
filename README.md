# Simple
Roll Your Own -- only includes gulp and browsersync.

## Before Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- And I recommend [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

To download the currect repo, 
1. change into the desired directory and clone the repo. 
1. open the repo folder in your command line, and run `yarn` to install.
1. run gulp to build your site and watch your files for changes as you develop. Your development site is the folder called `pages` -- simply update your files there to view them in the browser, and create teh subfolders you need.
