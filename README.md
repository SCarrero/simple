# Simple
Roll Your Own -- only includes gulp and browsersync.

## Before Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- And I recommend [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## To Install
- [Create your repo from this template](https://github.com/slycreations/simple/generate)
- Do your own thing from that point on. 
- The repo is initially set up so that the development site is the folder called `pages` -- simply update files in that folder to view them in the browser, and create the subfolders you need. A sample css file is included.
