# Simple
Roll Your Own -- only includes gulp and browsersync.

## Before Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- And I recommend [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## To Install
- [Create your repo from this template](https://github.com/slycreations/simple/generate)
- Clone and install your new repo locally.
- Run `gulp` (or `yarn start`) to start up localhost and watch your files.
- The repo is initially set up so that the development site is the folder called `pages`, and a sample css file is included.
- Do your own thing from that point on. 
- This is for development only, any steps to create production ready, minified, uglified code should be done outside of this repo.
